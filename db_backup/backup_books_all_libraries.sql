Every company, indeed every organization, is a tribe, or if it''s large enough, a network of tribes—groups of 20 to 150 people in which everyone knows everyone else, or at least knows of everyone else. Tribes are more powerful than teams, companies, or even CEOs, and yet their key leverage points have not been mapped—until now. In Tribal Leadership, Dave Logan, John King, and Halee Fischer-Wright show leaders how to assess their organization''s tribal culture on a scale from one to five and then implement specific tools to elevate the stage to the next. The result is unprecedented success. In a rigorous eight-year study of approximately 24,000 people in over two dozen corporations, Logan, King, and Fischer-Wright refine and define a common theme: the success of a company depends on its tribes, the strength of its tribes is determined by the tribal culture, and a thriving corporate culture can be established by an effective tribal leader. Tribal Leadership will show leaders how to employ their companies'' tribes to maximize productivity and profit: the authors'' research, backed up with interviews ranging from Brian France (CEO of NASCAR) to "Dilbert" creator Scott Adams, shows that over three quarters of the organizations they''ve studied have tribal cultures that are merely adequate, no better than the third of five tribal stages. Leaders, managers, and organizations that fail to understand, motivate, and grow their tribes will find it impossible to succeed in an increasingly fragmented world of business. The often counterintuitive findings of Tribal Leadership will help leaders at today''s major corporations, small businesses, and nonprofits learn how to take the people in their organization from adequate to outstanding, to discover the secrets that have led the highest-level tribes (like the team at Apple that designed the iPod) to remarkable heights, and to find new ways to succeed where others have failed.', 'http://books.google.com.br/books/content?id=pwP3lgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api', 9780061251306, 320, '2008-01-22', 'HarperBusiness', 'Leveraging Natural Groups to Build a Thriving Organization', 'Tribal Leadership');

In Scrum projects, the product owner plays a pivotal role, but until recently, few have been trained in the unique skills, techniques, and attitudes they need to succeed in this role. That''s why courses on Scrum product ownership are soaring in popularity - and it''s why this book is so important. Agile Product Management with Scrum is the first book to define and describe the role of agile product ownership in a systematic and comprehensive way. It covers a broad range of agile practices from the product owner''s perspective, including product vision, exploration, user stories, use cases, ''planning poker,'' sprints, release planning, portfolio management, and more. Drawing on extensive experience helping organizations succeed with Scrum, top agile consultant Roman Pichler gets down to the brass tacks: saving time and money while improving both quality and agility. He also addresses critical upstream processes and ''fuzzy front end'' that organizations must get right if they are to adopt Scrum across the enterprise. This practical book is an indispensable resource for everyone who plays the role of product owner, or anticipates doing so. It will also be extremely useful to all stakeholders who interact with product owners - which is to say, the entire Scrum project team.', 'http://books.google.com.br/books/content?id=QZDNPwAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api', 9780321605788, 133, '2010', 'Addison-Wesley Professional', 'Creating Products that Customers Love', 'Agile Product Management with Scrum');

There is also a Python 3.3+ version available.* "Writing Idiomatic Python" contains the most common and important Python idioms in a format that maximizes identification and understanding. Each idiom is presented as a recommendation to write some commonly used piece of code. It is followed by an explanation of why the idiom is important. It also contains two code samples: the "Harmful" way to write it and the "Idiomatic" way. * The "Harmful" way helps you identify the idiom in your own code. * The "Idiomatic" way shows you how to easily translate that code into idiomatic Python.

The book helps you to continue to grow and clearly comes from people who have been there.” —Kent Beck, author of Extreme Programming Explained: Embrace Change “I found this book to be a great mix of solid advice and wonderful analogies!” —Martin Fowler, author of Refactoring and UML Distilled “I would buy a copy, read it twice, then tell all my colleagues to run out and grab a copy. This is a book I would never loan because I would worry about it being lost.” —Kevin Ruland, Management Science, MSG-Logistics “The wisdom and practical experience of the authors is obvious. The topics presented are relevant and useful.... By far its greatest strength for me has been the outstanding analogies—tracer bullets, broken windows, and the fabulous helicopter-based explanation of the need for orthogonality, especially in a crisis situation. I have little doubt that this book will eventually become an excellent source of useful information for journeymen programmers and expert mentors alike.” —John Lakos, author of Large-Scale C++ Software Design “This is the sort of book I will buy a dozen copies of when it comes out so I can give it to my clients.” —Eric Vought, Software Engineer “Most modern books on software development fail to cover the basics of what makes a great software developer, instead spending their time on syntax or technology where in reality the greatest leverage possible for any software team is in having talented developers who really know their craft well. An excellent book.” —Pete McBreen, Independent Consultant “Since reading this book, I have implemented many of the practical suggestions and tips it contains. Across the board, they have saved my company time and money while helping me get my job done quicker!

It covers topics ranging from personal responsibility and career development to architectural techniques for keeping your code flexible and easy to adapt and reuse. Read this book, and you''ll learn how to Fight software rot; Avoid the trap of duplicating knowledge; Write flexible, dynamic, and adaptable code; Avoid programming by coincidence; Bullet-proof your code with contracts, assertions, and exceptions; Capture real requirements; Test ruthlessly and effectively; Delight your users; Build teams of pragmatic programmers; and Make your developments more precise with automation. Written as a series of self-contained sections and filled with entertaining anecdotes, thoughtful examples, and interesting analogies, The Pragmatic Programmer illustrates the best practices and major pitfalls of many different aspects of software development. Whether you''re a new coder, an experienced programmer, or a manager responsible for software projects, use these lessons daily, and you''ll quickly see improvements in personal productivity, accuracy, and job satisfaction. You''ll learn skills and develop habits and attitudes that form the foundation for long-term success in your career.

This one''s a keeper." --Robert C. Martin "If you want to be an expert in the state of the art in TDD, you need to understand the ideas in this book."--Michael Feathers Test-Driven Development (TDD) is now an established technique for delivering better software faster. TDD is based on a simple idea: Write tests for your code before you write the code itself. However, this "simple" idea takes skill and judgment to do well. Now there''s a practical guide to TDD that takes you beyond the basic concepts. Drawing on a decade of experience building real-world systems, two TDD pioneers show how to let tests guide your development and "grow" software that is coherent, reliable, and maintainable. Steve Freeman and Nat Pryce describe the processes they use, the design principles they strive to achieve, and some of the tools that help them get the job done. Through an extended worked example, you''ll learn how TDD works at multiple levels, using tests to drive the features and the object-oriented structure of the code, and using Mock Objects to discover and then describe relationships between objects. Along the way, the book systematically addresses challenges that development teams encounter with TDD--from integrating TDD into your processes to testing your most difficult features. Coverage includes * Implementing TDD effectively: getting started, and maintaining your momentum throughout the project * Creating cleaner, more expressive, more sustainable code * Using tests to stay relentlessly focused on sustaining quality * Understanding how TDD, Mock Objects, and Object-Oriented Design come together in the context of a real software development project * Using Mock Objects to guide object-oriented designs * Succeeding where TDD is difficult: managing complex test data, and testing persistence and concurrency', 'http://books.google.com.br/books/content?id=vkb7mAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api', 9780321503626, 358, '2010', 'Addison-Wesley Professional', NULL, 'Growing Object-oriented Software, Guided by Tests');
